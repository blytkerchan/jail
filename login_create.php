<h1>Creating a login</h1>
<p>To create a new user account ("login") simply log in with the user and 
password you would like: a user account will be created for you. You can pick
any username and password you like (just don't use a valuable password as this
site is not secure). Your login will be completely anonymous: there is no way
for me (or anyone else AFAIK) to link your account to you.</p>
<p>The data we store in the database is: your username, your password in a garbled form and a unique ID of your account, which will also serve as a session ID.
This ID is linked to the bookmarks you have stored, and will allow you to store
new ones. There is a field for your E-mail address in the database, but you will
only be asked to fill it in if you leave a comment (and even in that case, it
is optional).</p>
<p>Other information concerning your session - such as to remember it for 30
days - is stored on your computer. The site itself doesn't remember your session
at all, but simply sends you a persistant cookie (or rather: two) which will 
be deleted when you log out.</p>
<p>Personal information, such as your IP address, the date and time of your 
visit, etc., are not stored on this site - though that information is more 
or less public, which means anyone can basically get at it without any problem.
