<h2>"Everything is an item"</h2>
<p>IMHO, the following text (taken from jail-ust-lang) is very clear on the
subject:</p>
<p><i>
The concept, once understood, is actually a simple one: if everything is an
object, the mere fact that it's an object means it has certain attributes in
common with everything else.<br/>
For example: an apple and an orange are both fruits. Being a fruit means they
are used by the plant they came from to reproduice, and means that we can
usually eat it. Hence, both oranges and applies are part of the group "fruit"
which "inherits" from the group "food" and the group "reproductive device"
like this:
<pre>
                             +------+
                             | item |
                             +------+
                                |
                                /
                                |
                        +-------+---------+
                        |                 |
             +----------+----------+   +--+---+
             | reproductive device |   | food |
             +---------------------+   +------+
                        |                 |
                        +---------+-------+
                                  |
                              +---+---+
                              | fruit |
                              +-------+
                                  |
                            +-----+----+
                            |          |
                       +----+---+  +---+---+
                       | orange |  | apple |
                       +--------+  +-------+
</pre>
This ASCII art basically means that reproductive devices and foodstuff are
items (they both "inherit" from the "class" item) and fruit "inherits" from
both. Where are the oranges and apples in this graph? They inherit from the
class "fruit" and are therefore both fruits, but with some different
properties.<br/>
That's the whole idea of object-oriented design (OOD): classes (i.e. kinds of
objects) have different properties (attributes and functions) and can inherit
from eachother (i.e. the class orange is a child of the class fruit, sharing
the properties that make it a fruit but having some properties that make it
an orange (color, taste, etc.)<br/>
(...)<br/>
Now, then. How is all of this interesting for Jail? Jail is an object-oriented
language due to the "Everything is an item" paradigm. This means all you will
every see of an item is the item interface. The question is: what should this
interface do by default?<br/>
What I've come up with so far is this: every item has three functions by
default (functions that are, of course, also items):
<ul>
<li>construct<br/>
creates the item, initializes everything it owns to their default values</li>
<li>destruct<br/>
destroys the item</li>
<li>body<br/>
does whatever needs to be done when the item is called as a function</li>
</ul>
By default, each of these will be empty, except for the constructor, which will fill in local variables with their default values, etc. When no function name
is specified and the compiler finds code, it will be put in the body.<br/>
Any of these functions can be overridden.<br/>

<h2>"Soft typing: new keywords, inheritance, etc."</h2>
<p>
The following text - taken from YA mail - describes a set of four keywords that brings the notion of types to Jail
</p>
<p>
Following the previous discussion on this list, I have somewhat changed the
typing model for the Jail language by introducing three new keywords (and one
which was already implied by the previous model, but not specified as such).<br/>
<ul>
<li>root</li>
<li>cast</li>
<li>extends</li>
<li>[of] type</li>
</ul>
The "extends" keyword specifies the parent of a new class. When ommitted, the
Item class is used - hence all classes still inherit from the Item super-class.
<pre>
        class Animal;
        class Cat extends Animal;
</pre>
Multiple inheritance is also possible:
<pre>
        class Animal;
        class Pet extends Animal;
        class Feline extends Animal;
        class Cat extends Pet, Feline;
or:     class Cat extends Pet and Feline;
</pre>
Precedence of inheritance is left-to-right - i.e. if both have a same property,
the one belonging to the class mentioned first is inherited and will be used
of called implicitly (but within Cat, it will still be possible to use a
Feline property present in both Pet and Feline: Feline::property will do the
trick).<br/>
Now, as for automatic downcasting - i.e. "everything is an Item". The hierarchy
of objects implicitly allows this behaviour *unless* it is specified that it
should not, using the new "root" keyword:
<pre>
root class Plant;
</pre>
this makes it impossible for a Plant to be seen as anything but a plant - and
as such makes it incompatible with all types below it in the hierarchy.
In the case of double inheritance, there may be two roots. If the wanted type is found somewhere up from either root, but below the type itself, without
casting to another branch in the hierarchy, it is compatible. I.e.:
<pre>
        root class Plant;
        class Flowery extends Plant;
        root class Shrubbery extends Plant;
        class Phaseolus extends Flowery, Shrubbery;
</pre>
Phaseolus will be compatible with Plant, despite Shrubbery being a root class,
because it inherits that compatibility from Flowery.<br/>
I expect this situation to be rather rare.<br/>
As for functions that expect a certain item type, there is the new "[of] type"
keyword (i.e. "of" is optional):
<pre>
function func (param of type File);
</pre>
The function func may now be sure that the parameter "param" is of type "File"
when it is passed - a type incompatible with File cannot be used and will cause a compile-time error.<br/>
This means that param can be:
<ul>
<li>an object of class File</li>
<li>an object of a class that inherits from File and is not rooted between the
  File class and itself</li>
<li>an object of a class that can be cast to File</li>
</ul>
The latter implies another new keyword: "cast", which will denote a cast
operator:
<pre>
        class MyClass
        begin
                cast of type File
                begin
                        [...]
                end;
        end;
</pre>
