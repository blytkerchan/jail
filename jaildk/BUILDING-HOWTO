The project, as such, cannot be built: you can't just check out the libcontain
module and hope that a simple './configure && make' will work - it won't. The
same goes for every other module in CVS - you simply can't build them without
some special action.

The reason for this is that most of the modules in CVS depend on eachother 
to be built: libcontain for example, needs libmemory, libreplace and arch to
work - libmemory for memory management, arch for the architecture-dependant
code and libreplace for the non-portable but widely-used functions (such as
memcmp, strdup, etc.).

The CVSROOT/modules file contains a number of "virtual" CVS modules which 
can be used to check out the different modules for building. Each of those
modules, once checked out, contains a script called ``bootstrap''. That script 
is used to pre-configure the building - i.e. generate the configure script
that will generate the Makefile.

Jail-ust uses the GNU Autotools for its compilation configuration. The
bootstrap script will therefore need recent versions of:
*	GNU autoconf
*	GNU libtool
As of July 2004, we no longer use GNU automake. The reason for this is *not* 
the fact that it creates huge and clunky Makefile.in files, *nor* the fact that
automake depends on recursive makes, which is considered harmful (see 
$CVSROOT/doc/auug97.pdf), but because in July 2004, I've centralized all of
the configury in a single module, called config. This uses a non-recursive
Makefile and requires easier-to-maintain module.mk files in each module.

Hence, the way to build any of the libraries or other packages in this
project is illustrated by libcontain:
$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/jail-ust
$ cvs login
<< enter anoncvs as password >>
$ cvs co release-libcontain
<< libcontain and everything it depends on is checked out >>
$ cd libcontain
$ bash bootstrap # note: you really need Bash!
$ mkdir .build
$ cd .build
$ ../configure
$ make		 # note: you need GNU Make
$ make check
$ make install

This entire process is also run through by the mksnap script, which is run 
periodically and nags to me about compilation errors by mail.

Current modules can always be found in ${CVSROOT]/CVSROOT/modules, which is
always up-to-date. The list below is current for today, Thu Oct 14 17:34:21 EST
2004.
release-libcontain:	anything needed to build (and release) libcontain
release-libmemory:	ditto for libmemory
release-preprocessor:	ditto for jailpp
release-libconf:	ditto for libconf
release-libthread:	ditto for libthread
