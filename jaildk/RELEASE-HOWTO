This document briefly describes how to make a release of one of the sub-projects
of the Jail project.

To make a release of the libcontain containers library
======================================================
1. Check out release-libcontain (update CVSROOT/modules if need be)
2. compile, run the tests, fix the bugs, etc.
3. check in your fixes
4. tag the CVS repo with a release tag (release_<date-like-20040203|version_like_0_0__1>)
5. EXPORT release-libcontain
6. compile, run the tests, make dist
7. check that the dist tarball doesn't contain anything it shouldn't (cache dirs, CVS dirs, etc.)
8. read https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6445&group_id=1
   and follow the instructions
9. announce on the proper mailing lists
