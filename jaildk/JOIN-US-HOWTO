This file describes how to join the development of the Jail project. It
contains information relevant to the different kinds of contributors to the
project - those that discuss the language and those that work on its
implementation.

* If you want to help define the language's semantics, grammar and syntax,
  please join the jail-ust-lang discussion group by sending an E-mail to
  jail-ust-lang-subscribe@lists.sourceforge.net. The E-mail's body is not
  important (and will not be read).
* If you want to help with the development of the language, the toolchain and
  the different components that make up the toolchain, follow the following
  procedure:
  1. read the ROADMAP file in this directory
  2. decide which part you would like to work on, according to your
     programming skills and what you would like to learn.
     For every part of the development that needs to be done, you are welcome
     to join in the development if you are either willing to learn, or have
     some knowledge on the subject. The only requirement is that you read up
     on a thread before chiming in on it.
  3. Once you've decided what code you would like to work on, if it exists
     already, read that code.
  4. If discussion has already taken place on jail-ust-devel on the part of
     the toolchain you would like to work on, read up on it and join in.
     Otherwise, feel free to start a new thread.
  5. Subscribe to the jail-ust-devel list: it's a subscribers-only list and
     all project members must be subscribed. Unsubscribing from the list means
     you'll be removed from the project, subscribing to the list makes you a
     possible candidate for addition to the project members (which entails CVS
     write access).

That's pretty much it!
