<h1><a name="How_you_can_help"></a>How you can help</h1>
<p>The language (Jail) and the programs that implement it are a
work in progress. We need</p>
<ul>
<li>People from the intended audience<br>
Meaning people who may not know the difference between "Word" and
"Windows", may never have programmed anything in their lives but
want their computers to simply behave.<br>
If you want to automate a task on your computer but you don't know
how to do it - you're part of the intended audience!</li>
<li>More people from the intended audience<br>
Meaning people who know how to program, perhaps make a living doing
so, but want to learn and help create a new programming language
designed to
<ul>
<li>make object-oriented programming easy</li>
<li>make self-modifying code a piece of cake</li>
<li>be portable</li>
<li>be easy to learn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yet more people from the intended audience<br>
i.e. anyone between the two beforementioned groups</li>
<li>Programmers who want to help make the preprocessor, compiler
and/or virtual machine</li>
<li>Linguists who want to help define the language</li>
<li>Biologists who want to use the language for DNA sequence
analysis</li>
<li>Lawyers who want to use the language to keep track of their
bibliography</li>
<li>Managers and marketers who want to use it to manage
databases</li>
<li>everybody else!</li>
</ul>
<p>We need all those people to put their heads together and define
the language we call Jail.</p>
