The configuration file format:

* anything from a semicolon (;) or a pound (#) to the end of line is a comment
* lists are separated by colons (:)
* config token names must start with an alphabetic character, a dot or an 
  underscore and may further contain numeric characters - i.e., they must
  correspond to the following regex:
  	/[A-Za-z._]+[A-Za-z0-9._]*/
