version 0.1-alpha1
------------------
Mon, Mar 08, 2004: To be more helpful for the cgdb project, an implementation
of a hashtable written only in C was needed. For the time being, the one from
glib was "ported" into libcontain.
The license of glib is the GNU LGPL, which is strictly speaking not compatible 
with the Jail license the rest of the library falls unde falls under. To not 
have the effects of that license on your program (which will only bother you
if you have a GPL-waiver from me) don't use the glib implementation: configure
with the ``--without-glib'' option.
The reason for using glib was that it's implemented in C whereas the provided
implementation is written in C++. You can turn the provided implementation 
off with ``--without-cxx''.
Note that if you do both --without-cxx and --without-glib, you're left without
a hash table implementation.

version 0.0-alpha3
------------------
Thu, Feb 12, 2004: In my list implementation, the variables marked as "private"
in the algorithm description were put in the list_t type, which basically means
they were part of the list descriptor. That means that they were inherently 
shared among threads, which means that the implementation wasn't thread-safe
at all.
I've created a new type, list_state_t, which is used in the list implementation
by each of the functions that calls list_find(). list_find and all of its
callers will use a local copy of the state, which is allocated on the stack
and which is therefore local to the thread. This should make the list 
thread-safe.

version 0.0-alpha2
------------------
Tue, Feb 10, 2004: I've just finished implementing the lists described by 
M.M. Micheal, though I haven't used his "tag" to prevent the ABA problem:
I will be using the SMR memory management method later on, and I don't have
a CAS that will take both the pointer and the tag at the same time, at the
moment. (That, and I don't want to count on the alignment of the structure
in memory...).
Apart from that, a major new thing is that all of the hash classes actually 
compile now, and that the final library actually contains all of the containers
which was not the case in the previous release.
We still need testcases for all of the non-hash objects, though.., and the
README file isn't quite up-to-date yet..

version 0.0-alpha1
------------------
Tue, Feb 3, 2004: first alpha release of the container library - no testing 
has been done whatsoever, except on the hash. I haven't even taken the time to
re-read the documentation yet. The implementations should work, though, and 
have been tested marginally separately, but as the testsuite hasn't been 
implemented yet, there's not much to guarantee that anything here will
actually work.
