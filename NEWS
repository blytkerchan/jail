New News
========
Tue, Feb 10, 2004: I've just finished implementing the lists described by 
M.M. Micheal, though I haven't used his "tag" to prevent the ABA problem:
I will be using the SMR memory management method later on, and I don't have
a CAS that will take both the pointer and the tag at the same time, at the
moment. (That, and I don't want to count on the alignment of the structure
in memory...).
Apart from that, a major new thing is that all of the hash classes actually 
compile now, and that the final library actually contains all of the containers
which was not the case in the previous release.
We still need testcases for all of the non-hash objects, though.., and the
README file isn't quite up-to-date yet..

Old News
========
Tue, Feb 3, 2004: first alpha release of the container library - no testing 
has been done whatsoever, except on the hash. I haven't even taken the time to
re-read the documentation yet. The implementations should work, though, and 
have been tested marginally separately, but as the testsuite hasn't been 
implemented yet, there's not much to guarantee that anything here will
actually work.
