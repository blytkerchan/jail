The following is a wishlist for the Jail-ust site:
* users are able to log in, create comments, bookmarks, etc. This should be
  kept and possibly enhanced a bit
* I (rlc) wrote a couple of Perl scripts for polling a while ago, but never
  actually put them on the site - mostly because they're not completely
  finished. It would be nice if we had an easy way to poll the public - not
  necessarilly using those scripts. Check the scripts and the database layout
  for the info we want and the way we want to ask..
* The site can remember a user's login, but a "remembered" used should not be
  allowed to do everything a freshly logged-in user can - most notably to
  change his credentials, he should be fresh.
* Single quotes in text entered in the database are not displayed. As we're
  defining a language in which single quotes play at least a minor role, this
  may be important to fix.
* The content of the site, currently in htdocsa/texts, should go into the
  database. However, it should be easy to edit it (e.g. import & export in 
  SGML/XML (DocBook) form)
* We might need (and I would like) a Wiki
* Forums are already provided by SourceForge, so may not be all too important.
  If we do decide to add a forum, it should at least be linked to the proper
  mailing lists somehow (e.g. be a forum-like interface to the mailing list).
* It would be nice to be able to track the changed made in CVS through the 
  site: we already have a jail-ust-cvs list, but it would be nice to have an
  easy-to-understand web interface as well. If need be, a script can be called
  on commit.
* It would be nice to make the site search-able..
* It would be nice to make it a bit easier for a bot (such as Google) to visit
  the site - improve our indexing a bit..

However:
* existing booksmarks should keep working
* Changes to the site should be noted in the ChangeLog
* The PHP code of the site must be under some open source license..
