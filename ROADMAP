This file describes the structure of the CVS repository of the Jail project.

The CVS repository currently contains five "modules":
* compiler
  This directory contains the files directly related to the compiler. The 
  compiler is the tool that translates preprocessed source code to JailVM 
  assembler code - it doesn't do *anything* else.
  If you want to work on this component, the required skills (the ones you have
  or want to learn) are:
  - YACC
    for the parser: if you want to modify the grammar or the semantics of the 
    language's implementation
  - LEX
    for the scanner: if you want to modify the keywords and how they are 
    recognised
  - C
    for the rest
* htdocs
  This directory contains the website sources - available at jail-ust.sf.net
  If you want to work on this, you need to know about HTML.
* jaildk
  This directory contains the files that describe how you can join the 
  development of the project. You can't work on this unless you're a project
  admin.
* libcontain
  This directory contains the containers library. If you want to work on this
  the required skills (the ones you have or want to learn) are:
  - C++
    for the Hash library classes
  - C
    for the C interface
* standards
  This directory contains the coding and other standards applicable to the
  project. You can't work on this unless you're a project admin.

it also contains three files at the root:
* license.h
  This is the applicable license that should be added to all source and header 
  files in the project. It is a BSD-like license that covers the source file 
  with both the license itself and the GNU General Public License, unless 
  otherwise specified by rlc. Read jaildk/licensing for details.
* AUTHORS
  This is the list of authors of the files at the root - normally this only
  contains me (rlc)
* ChangeLog
  These are the changes made to the files at the root of the repository.
