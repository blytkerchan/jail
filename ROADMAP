This file describes the structure of the CVS repository of the Jail project.

The CVS repository currently contains five "modules":
* compiler
  This directory contains the files directly related to the compiler. The 
  compiler is the tool that translates preprocessed source code to JailVM 
  assembler code - it doesn't do *anything* else.
  If you want to work on this component, the required skills (the ones you have
  or want to learn) are:
  - YACC
    for the parser: if you want to modify the grammar or the semantics of the 
    language's implementation
  - LEX
    for the scanner: if you want to modify the keywords and how they are 
    recognised
  - C
    for the rest
* htdocs
  This directory contains the website sources - available at jail-ust.sf.net
  If you want to work on this, you need to know about HTML.
* jaildk
  This directory contains the files that describe how you can join the 
  development of the project. You can't work on this unless you're a project
  admin.
* libcontain
  This directory contains the containers library. If you want to work on this
  the required skills (the ones you have or want to learn) are:
  - C++
    for the Hash library classes
  - C
    for the C interface
* standards
  This directory contains the coding and other standards applicable to the
  project. You can't work on this unless you're a project admin.

it also contains three files at the root:
* license.h
  This is the applicable license that should be added to all source and header 
  files in the project. It is a BSD-like license that covers the source file 
  with both the license itself and the GNU General Public License, unless 
  otherwise specified by rlc. Read jaildk/licensing for details.
* AUTHORS
  This is the list of authors of the files at the root - normally this only
  contains me (rlc)
* ChangeLog
  These are the changes made to the files at the root of the repository.
 
Generally, shared libraries are found at the root, and shared features are
found in those libraries. The toolchain is divided into several parts, each
of which have their own directory, at the root. Within those directories, 
there may be a subdivision of the sources according to the features they
implement. Libraries that don't get used outside of the component they are
made for are, for example, found in the directory of the component. If they
ever get moved "down" the tree, CVS mechanisms will be used to make that 
possible (alias modules).

Some directories that don't exist yet at the time of writing, but will soon:

preprocessor	the files for the preprocessor
libdb		the files for the shared database manager
arch		architecture-dependant code
config		configuration (and IDE project) files

This file is subject of discussion on the jail-ust-devel list - as is the tree
it describes. The tree itself is not subject to any standards, but must at 
least be coherent.
