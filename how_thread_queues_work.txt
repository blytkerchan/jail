How thread queues work
======================

The problem:
-----------
To create a queue of thread descriptors
* using the thread descriptors as nodes
* making sure that once the thread descriptor has been de-queued, it is really 
  no longer in the queue (i.e. don't use it as a stub node)
* without using locks

The rationale of the problem:
----------------------------
We want to use thread descriptors as nodes to avoid chicken-and-egg problems 
and memory allocation overheads: the chicken-and-egg problem would occur if 
the queue were used in a lock that were used for the memory allocation used
by the queue, for example.
We don't want the thread descriptor to "hang around" in the queue after being 
de-queued because it may have to be used in another queue.
We don't want to use locks because we want to be fast, robust, etc. - and 
because we're implementing this queue to use for implementing locks, so we
want to avoid chicken-and-egg problems again.

The solution - step one:
-----------------------
Adopt and adapt the queue algorithm from libcontain, using thread descriptors
as nodes: the algorithm doesn't use locks but does keep a node around when 
de-queued. Hence, the real problem to solve is how to make sure the nodes we
dequeue don't stick around.

The solution - step two:
-----------------------
Add a dummy node! This node will always be in the queue, and will be added to 
the queue every time it is popped off. Hence:
* an empty queue only contains the dummy node
  i.e. head == tail == dummy && dummy^.next == NULL
* if a deq de-queues the dummy, we re-queue it and de-queue another node
* where we'd free a node in the original queue algorithm, we've actually found
  the node we want
Now, only one dummy node may not be enough for concurrent deq's: if we deq the
dummy another thread may deq another node while we enq the dummy, so deq-ing
the dummy should enq a new dummy first. Hence the lt_thread_t::flag should be
tagged "dummy" (or, appropriately, 0xdeadbeef) :)
