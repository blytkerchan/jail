The license applicable to Jail code is derived from the BSD license, with one
important exception: the GNU General Public License also applied unless the
licensee has a written statement saying otherwise from me (rlc).

The reason for this is to disallow commercial (non open-source) use of the Jail
source code to people who have not contributed to the Jail project in a 
significant way - either monetary or with code. If you want to use the Jail 
source code - go ahead, but if you want to close it, you must contribute to
it first.

Any monetary contributions will go into a special account used only for the
project - no developers (including myself) are paid for their work on the 
project.
