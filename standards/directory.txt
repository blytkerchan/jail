There are a few files that should always be present in a directory in the
project source tree:
* AUTHORS:	the list of authors that applies to the files in the directory
		with, for each author:
		- the pseudonym
		- the full name
		- the E-mail address
		- the role of the person in the project
		an entry might look like this:
		|	"blytkerchan": Ronald Landheer-Cieslak
		|		blytkerchan@users.sourceforge.net
		|		project leader/manager
* ChangeLog:	the list of changes applied to files in the directory
