2004-05-07	blytkerchan	First public release of this library

The libmemory library has been integrated into libcontain - the container 
library. This provides the container library with a solution the the ABA
problem and renders most of its containers completely thread-safe, bringing
the library a major step closer to its goal of providing blindingly fast,
non-blocking container objects for C and C++ programs.

This has also brought this library, libmemory, a step closer to being ready
for use by the general public: some of the major drawbacks of the algorithm
and the implementation were resolved only because a resolution was needed at
the time. For example, the fact that one needs to know the maximum number of
participating threads for SMR was inacceptable for the applications libcontain
is needed for. That need has been removed by dynamically increasing and 
decreasing the thread counter and sizing the deletion queue according to that
counter.

What this library needs now is testing: there are no unit test cases for this
library at the moment (though the test cases in libcontain have helped in 
sorting out a few bugs) and aside from libcontain, no other library or 
application uses this implementation of SMR. Hence, the first alpha release
of this library is due. So here it is :)
