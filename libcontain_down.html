<h1>The Jail-Ust Container Library</h1>
<p>The goal of the Container library is to provide containers (objects that
contain other objects) for use by Jail-ust and other projects.<br/>
The library, though intended primarily for use in the development of Jail-ust,
is also intended for use by the general public which means that feature 
requests, bug reports, etc. for projects other than Jail-ust have a good 
chance to be entertained.</p>
<p>The Container library's primary (technical/technological) goals are:
<ul>
<li>To provide containers that are easy to use<br/>
Comprehensive interface, C bindings, etc.
</li>
<li>To provide thread-safe containers<br/>
Read operations must be thread-safe; write operations should also be 
thread-safe but may require some memory management. The goal is to make each
container thread-safe at least for all read operations, to clearly document
what operations are, and what operations are not, thread-safe.</li>
<li>To be "blindingly" fast<br/>
Speed, next to ease of use and thread-safety, is of primary concern 
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Version 0.0-alpha1</h2>
<p>This is the first alpha release of the Container library. It contains 
implementations for the following objects:
<ul>
<li><b>A queue</b><br/>
The provided queue is aimed at being fast and uses a non-blocking algorithm
described by Micheal and Scott in 1996 [<a href="#ref1">1</a>].<br/>
Enqueueing is thread-safe; dequeueing isn't yet: memory management has not
been implemented yet, which means a freed node can't be safely de-allocated
yet, which in turn means that a de-queued node can't be safely freed yet.<br/>
This basically means you can compile a <code>deq</code> with any number of 
<code>enq</code> actions, but you can only have one deq at the same time.
</li>
<li><b>A stack</b><br/>
The provides stack is aimed at being fast and uses a non-blocking algorithm.
<br/>
Due to the lack of memory management, the stack is currently not thread-safe
for popping, but both reading the top element and pushing are thread-safe.<br/>
This basically means you shouldn't <code>pop</code> from two threads at the 
same time, but you can combine a single <code>pop</code> action with any number
of <code>top</code> and <code>push</code> actions.</li>
<li><b>A hash</b><br/>
The hash included in the library is taken from the Real Life Systems hash 
library, which is the immediate precursor to the Container library. It was
not ogirinally designed to be thread-safe and is written in C++. The C 
interface functions were added for the Container library.<br/>
Currently, the Hash class and its derivatives are not thread-safe yet. There
should be no problem with concurrent reads, but write actions should not be
combined with any other actions (including read actions).<br/>
Making the hash thread-safe for concurrent write operations requires serious
re-factoring of the underlying implementation and will probably have to wait
until a thread-safe list has been implemented, so linear hashing can be 
replaced by list-based hashing (every bucket containing a list).<br/>
Basically, this means you should see the current hash implementation as a 
dictionary: write it once and read it often. As this is the most "usual" use
of a hash anyway, that should not pose much of a problem.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Some containers are still in the design phase and are therefore not included
in the library at this time. These include:
<ul>
<li><b>A list</b><br/>
Based on M.M. Micheal's lock-free list algorithm [<a href="#ref2">2</a>], the 
list will enable the creation of a list-based hash to replace the current 
implementation, will be fast, non-blocking and thread-safe.</li>
<li><b>A map</b><br/>
Because it is difficult to write good hashing functions for use with a hash,
a map, though slower, will allow the same type of fast, key-based access to 
stored elements.</li>
<li><b>A heap</b></li>
</ul>
Currently, only the list is under active development, but it will probably not
be ready before the current release reaches the Final stage.
