<h2><a name="Design"></a>Language design</h2>
<p><i>The language has to be very simple to use for anyone.</i></p>
<p>One thing that has bothered people learning to program in
languages like Perl has been the notation of the different types of
variables. For example, in Perl, scalars are prefixed with a $,
arrays with a @ and hashes with a %. These three make the code
slightly complicated. With that, an accolade has a different
meaning according to its context, and if you want an item of an
array, you have to write the name of that item as a scalar..</p>
<p>In Jail, we don't see the difference between an array and a
hash: an array is a hash. We don't see the difference between a
scalar and an array either: an array can be a scalar if you need it
do be one. Either way, you're working on <b>items</b>, so let's
just call it that.</p>
<h3><a name="Everything_is_an_item"></a>Everything is an item</h3>
<p>A scalar, an array, a file, a function, the program itself. To
quote my little brother: "difference the what's?!". Of course, you
might run into trouble assigning a value to a function - and the
interpreter should warn you about that - but that doesn't mean it's
wrong to do so!</p>
<p>Of course, there are things you can do with one item that you
can't with another: it doesn't make sense to multiply a file by
two, unless it makes sense to multiply its contents by two.. The
interpreter should warn the programmer about that, but that's
another question: if the programmer decides to multiply a file,
he'll get a multiplied file.. It's just a question of deciding on
the semantics of the operation and the operation can be done.</p>
<h3><a name="Grammar_and_syntax"></a>Grammar and syntax</h3>
<p>The grammar of Jail is under development. Basically, what we
need is a simple, straight-forward grammar to be used with a syntax
that is, also, as simple as possible.</p>
<p>The programmer shouldn't have to care about the type behind an
item: all they have to deal with are items and expressions, a
program just being a complex form of an expression. Hence, the
grammar should define rules for the use of items and the contents
of expressions, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>An expression is one of the following:
<ul>
<li>an item</li>
<li>an expression, followed by an operator, followed by an
expression</li>
<li>an expression between brackets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A function call is an item followed by zero or more expressions
between brackets</li>
</ul>
The restrictions on the grammar are those imposed by the parser
generator we use, which is GNU Bison. The complete grammar is not
complete yet, but is under development. If you want to have the
current snapshot, you can always mail me at <i>ronald at landheer
dot com</i> but it you want to discuss it, please mail to
<i>jail-ust-lang-subscribe at lists dot sourceforge dot net</i>.
That will subscribe you to the language discussion mailing list
which is meant to define the semantics, syntax and grammar of the
language.
<p>We also need to define what names the programmer can give to his
items. I've reserved anything that starts with an underscore for
keywords. We don't need many keywords at the moment - some of the
keywords I can think of at the moment are:</p>
<ul>
<li>PROGRAM to denote the program currently running</li>
<li>ERROR to denote an error</li>
<li>OK to denote all is well</li>
<li>BEGIN, END, WHILE, DO<br></li>
</ul>
Other than the reserved words any sequence of one or more
alphanumeric characters, starting with a letter, should be OK for
use. However, anything starting with an underscore will be reserved
for future, or internal, use.<br>
<p>Some symbols may be pre-defined, such as console, stdin, stdout,
stderr, etc. The complete list of pre-defined symbols and what they
are for has yet to be defined. Again, if you want to join the
discussion, please mail to <i>jail-ust-lang-subscribe at lists dot
sourceforge dot net</i>.</p>
<h3><a name="Error_and_exception_handling"></a>Error and exception
handling</h3>
<p>Anybody who's tried teaching C++ to non-programmers will have
run into the problem of explaining what an exception is: you can
throw them and catch them like a ball, they can be of any type that
can be thrown, they usually denote an error but they can be used as
any part of a design, etc. etc. Due to exceptions, you need smart
pointers (what's a pointer again?) your code needs to be
exception-safe, etc. etc. The problems with exceptions are as
numerous as those with threads, and some of them are related,
too.</p>
<p>Some errors can be expected and can be handled gracefully. For
example, if the programmer writes a division, the divisor might be
zero, and division by zero is mathematically impossible. In stead
of just breaking the program, the interpreter can "gracefully"
handle this by setting the result to "not a number" and outputting
a warning message to the standard error device.</p>
<p>No error should be fatal: the interpreter should never bail out
screaming - that will only confuse the user and the programmer
alike. OTOH, the principle of JIJO (Junk In Junk Out) should be
upheld: if you give the interpreter a buggy program you should
expect the interpreter to give you plenty of warnings, and perhaps
do a lot of no-ops, but <i>it should never bail out</i>.</p>
<p>OTOH, we can't decide aforehand how each error/exception should
be handled. The technical architecture of the Jail Virtual Machine
therefore has to include a way to handle different types of
exceptions, ranging from division-by-zero to access violations. For
this, the JailVM will use user-provided callback functions, which
will be called in a similar way to signal handlers. These can
either be written in Jail or in some other language.</p>
