/** \mainpage An implementation of the Visitor pattern
 * I recently read an article in IEEE Computer about the Visitor pattern and
 * "Componentization" ("Componentization: The Visitor Example", B. Meyer & 
 * K. Arnout, IEEE Computer, July 2006 (Vol. 39, No. 7) pp. 23-30). I found
 * their argument, that design patterns make for reusable patterns but not
 * reusable software components, compelling and the example of the Visitor
 * pattern very interesting, as a Visitor is definitely something you'd need
 * to visit a parse tree written in C++.
 * I checked Andrei Alexandrescu's solution from Modern C++ Design
 * (Addison-Wesley, 2001) and found it oddly lacked flexibility... */
