<h2>Who we need</h2>
<p>The language (Jail) and the programs that implement it are a
work in progress. We need</p>
<ul>
<li>People from the intended audience<br>
Meaning people who may not know the difference between "Word" and
"Windows", may never have programmed anything in their lives but
want their computers to simply behave.<br>
If you want to automate a task on your computer but you don't know
how to do it - you're part of the intended audience!</li>
<li>More people from the intended audience<br>
Meaning people who know how to program, perhaps make a living doing
so, but want to learn and help create a new programming language
designed to
<ul>
<li>make object-oriented programming easy</li>
<li>make self-modifying code a piece of cake</li>
<li>be portable</li>
<li>be easy to learn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yet more people from the intended audience<br>
i.e. anyone between the two beforementioned groups</li>
<li>Programmers who want to help make the preprocessor, compiler
and/or virtual machine</li>
<li>Linguists who want to help define the language</li>
<li>Biologists who want to use the language for DNA sequence
analysis</li>
<li>Lawyers who want to use the language to keep track of their
bibliography</li>
<li>Managers and marketers who want to use it to manage
databases</li>
<li>everybody else!</li>
</ul>
<p>We need all those people to put their heads together and define
the language we call Jail.</p>

<h2>OK, so how can I help?</h2>
<p>Well, for starters, you can subscribe to the jail-ust-lang discussion group:
just send an E-mail to jail-ust-lang-subscribe at lists.sf.net and you will be
added to the group.</p>
<p>If you're a programmer (or a student in programming/computer science) you 
can help out with the development of the different components: we need porters
for the architecture-dependant code most at the moment, but if you want to do
something else, that's fine too.</p>
<p>We need testers as well: at the moment, the only actually released software
is aimed at developers, but things like the preprocessor will be released 
(hopefully) soon.</p>
<p>Proof-reading is nice too: in 
<?php link_to_section("language", "the language section") ?> of this site, 
there's a growing amount of documentation on the language that needs reading
and commenting. Comments should be sent to the jail-ust-lang list.</p>
