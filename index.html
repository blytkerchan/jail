JAIL</h1>
<p>Jail is Just Another Interpreted Language, and Uses Silly Terms.
So if you're wondering why Jail is called Jail: it's a
double-recursive acronym. Just one of the things the OLOCA made me
do.. (If you don't know what the OLOCA is, look <a href=
"http://cygwin.com/acronyms/#OLOCA">here</a>).</p>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net"></a>
<p>The Jail project is hosted by SourceForge.</p>
<p>If you came here looking for a full-fledged, ready-to-deploy
interpreted language, you're out of luck: have a look at Perl,
Ruby, Python, or some other interpreted language in stead.</p>
<p>If you came here looking to join the effort of defining a new
interpreted language with ambitous goals, you're exactly where
you're supposed to be.</p>
<p>On these pages you will find the description of the Jail language, the 
current status of development, how to join the effort of creating a new
object-oriented programming language, etc.</p>
<p>The intended audience of the Jail language is the part of humanity that wants to use a computer without knowing how it works, which (I believe) goes for the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>For most people, the Bash shell is too complicated; Perl, Ruby and Python are beyond reach; C and Pascal are way too complicated and C++ and Java are beyond their wildest dreams.</p>
<p><i>Jail is intended for those people for whom an accessible language is not available at this time.</i></p>
