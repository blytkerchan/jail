<h1><a name="Welcome_to_the_JAIL_home_page."></a>Welcome to
JAIL</h1>
<p>Jail is Just Another Interpreted Language, and Uses Silly Terms.
So if you're wondering why Jail is called Jail: it's a
double-recursive acronym. Just one of the things the OLOCA made me
do.. (If you don't know what the OLOCA is, look <a href=
"http://cygwin.com/acronyms/#OLOCA">here</a>).</p>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net"></a>
<p>The Jail project is hosted by SourceForge.</p>
<p>If you came here looking for a full-fledged, ready-to-deploy
interpreted language, you're out of luck: have a look at Perl,
Ruby, Python, or some other interpreted language in stead.</p>
<p>If you came here looking to join the effort of defining a new
interpreted language with ambitous goals, you're exactly where
you're supposed to be.</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="Intended_audience"></a>Intended audience</h2>
<p>The intended audience of the Jail language is the part of
humanity that wants to use a computer without knowing how it works,
which (I believe) goes for the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>For most people, the Bash shell is too complicated; Perl, Ruby
and Python are beyond reach; C and Pascal are way too complicated
and C++ and Java are beyond their wildest dreams.</p>
<p>Jail is intended for those people for whom an accessible
language is not available at this time.</p>
<h2><a name="Goals"></a>Goals</h2>
<p>The goals of the Jail project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To make a very portable interpreted language, that will run on
<ul>
<li>any Linux system (be it Red Hat, Mandrake, SuSE, Debian or
other)</li>
<li>any modern Windows system except Windows CE (using <a href=
"http://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>)</li>
<li>any BSD system (be it FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD or other)</li>
<li>any other POSIX system</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To make a very easy interpreted language, that can be used by
practically anyone
<ul>
<li>by clearly documenting every part of the language</li>
<li>by transparently converting from any scalar type to
another</li>
<li>by handling all memory allocation internally</li>
<li>by handling pass-by-value and pass-by-reference in a "natural"
way</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To make a very "powerful" language
<ul>
<li>by being object-oriented all the way</li>
<li>by implementing a small but complete instruction set</li>
<li>by implementing integrated database access</li>
<li>by implementing Perl-compatible regular expressions</li>
<li>by implementing a simple way to make graphical user interfaces
on top of X<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To make a secure language
<ul>
<li>e.g. by making the interpreter configurable as to what access
it should allow to system resources<br>
e.g. it should be possible to disallow file system access if the
administrator doesn't want you to have it (e.g. for downloaded
scripts embedded in HTML pages)</li>
<li>by taking security considerations into account from the very
start of the language's design</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="How_you_can_help"></a>How you can help</h2>
<p>The language (Jail) and the programs that implement it are a
work in progress. We need</p>
<ul>
<li>People from the intended audience<br>
Meaning people who may not know the difference between "Word" and
"Windows", may never have programmed anything in their lives but
want their computers to simply behave.<br>
If you want to automate a task on your computer but you don't know
how to do it - you're part of the intended audience!</li>
<li>More people from the intended audience<br>
Meaning people who know how to program, perhaps make a living doing
so, but want to learn and help create a new programming language
designed to</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>make object-oriented programming easy</li>
<li>make self-modifying code a piece of cake</li>
<li>be portable</li>
<li>be easy to learn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yet more people from the intended audience<br>
i.e. anyone between the two beforementioned groups</li>
<li>Programmers who want to help make the preprocessor, compiler
and/or virtual machine</li>
<li>Linguists who want to help define the language</li>
<li>Biologists who want to use the language for DNA sequence
analysis</li>
<li>Lawyers who want to use the language to keep track of their
bibliography</li>
<li>Managers and marketers who want to use it to manage
databases</li>
<li>everybody else!</li>
</ul>
<p>We need all those people to put their heads together and define
the language we call Jail.</p>
