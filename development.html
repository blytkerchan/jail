<h1>Development</h1>
<p>Development on the Jail preprocessor has started on Oct 1st 2003, with the
creation of the jail-ust-devel discussion group and the upload of the coding
standards I (rlc) use for most of my projects (which is a set of amendmends on
the GNU coding standards)</p>
<p>The preprocessor's goal will be to (evidently) preprocess Jail code, to
make it readible by the compiler itself. The preprocessor will need several 
libraries and (other) components that will be used by the other programs in
the Jail Interpreter Suite (compiler, linker, VM) as well. The first goals
will entail making those libraries/components.</p>
<h2>The Development Plan</h2>
<p>The first thing that will be implemented is a library of data containers,
derived from a library (libhash) I have previously developed. The original
libhash is not thread-safe but should be made so. It should also be extended
to make it easier to use and it should implement other hashing and storage 
algorithms, preferrably non-blocking ones.</p>
<p>The container library will need minimal memory management to work around 
certain problems. That memory management can be the first step to a 
full-fledged memory manager for the virtual machine.</p>
<p>After the container library, a lexical scanner will be needed for the 
preprocessor. This scanner will be at the heart of the preprocessor as it will
be used to recognise the different preprocessor tokens.</p>
<p>Whether or not the preprocessor will need a full-fledged parser depends on
how complicated the task of the preprocessor will be, which partly depends on 
the outcome of discussions on the jail-ust-lang and jail-ust-devel groups.</p>
<p>Aside from the preprocessor, we will need a compiler and the two will 
probably need to communicate with eachother and keep a database of known 
classes and their definitions. Hence, we will need a shared database library. 
That same library can be the basis of a more advanced database library that
might, if needed, allow access to external databases.</p>
<p>And so the list goes on. The plan is to start with the parts every other
part depends on, and work on it to get a minimal working implementation so we
can get started on other parts. The container library is such a part, so 
development on it is active. The memory manager is another such part.</p>


<!-- PUT THIS IS LICENSING.HTML
<p>Jail's licensing scheme revolves around a BSD-like license with an added
clause which lets me (rlc) decide whether or not the code is also covered by the
GNU General Public License, and for whom. I've copied this idea from Cygwin, as
I think it can be helpful in pushing people to making useful contributions. 
Written approval of publishing the code without covering it with the GNU Public
License will be granted to those who make a useful contribution to the project,
either by contributing source code, know-how or money. (Any money contributed
will be added to an account for the Jail project, that will serve only for the
project. None of the developers are paid).</p>
